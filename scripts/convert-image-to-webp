# 1. `find . -maxdepth 1 -type f \( -iname "*.jpg" -o -iname "*.png" -o -iname "*.jpeg" \) -print0`:
# 	* `find` is a command that searches for files based on various criteria.
# 	* `.` refers to the current working directory.
# 	* `-maxdepth 1` limits the search to only the current directory (i.e., it doesn't recurse into subdirectories).
# 	* `-type f` specifies that only files (not directories) should be considered.
# 	* `-iname` specifies a case-insensitive search for files with the specified extensions.
# 	* `\( -iname "*.jpg" -o -iname "*.png" -o -iname "*.jpeg" \)` is a group of conditions that match files with `.jpg`, `.png`, or `.jpeg` extensions.
# 	* `-print0` prints the names of the matching files, separated by null characters (`\0`) instead of newlines.
# 2. `xargs -0 mogrify -format webp`:
# 	* `xargs` is a command that takes input from standard input (in this case, the output of the `find` command) and uses it as arguments for a command (in this case, `mogrify`).
# 	* `-0` tells `xargs` to expect input items to be separated by null characters (`\0`) instead of newlines.
# 	* `mogrify` is a command that converts images to a specified format.
# 	* `-format webp` specifies that the images should be converted to WebP format.
# 3. `find . -maxdepth 1 -type f \( -iname "*.jpg" -o -iname "*.png" -o -iname "*.jpeg" \) -delete`:
# 	* This is another `find` command that searches for files with the same criteria as before (`.jpg`, `.png`, or `.jpeg` extensions).
# 	* `-delete` specifies that the matching files should be deleted.
# 4. `notify-send -t 60000 "Mogrify completed!" "$(date)"`:
# 	* `notify-send` is a command that sends a desktop notification.
# 	* `-t 60000` specifies that the notification should be displayed for 60 seconds (60000 milliseconds).
# 	* `"Mogrify completed!"` is the title of the notification.
# 	* `$(date)` is a command substitution that inserts the current date and time into the notification message.
# 5. `exit`:
# 	* This simply exits the script.

# 1. Find all `.jpg`, `.png`, and `.jpeg` files in the current directory.
# 2. Convert each of these files to WebP format using `mogrify`.
# 3. Delete the original `.jpg`, `.png`, and `.jpeg` files.
# 4. Send a desktop notification indicating that the conversion is complete, along with the current date and time.
# 5. Exit the script.
